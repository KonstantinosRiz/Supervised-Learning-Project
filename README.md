# Supervised Learning Project

In these projects we experiment with the basic classifiers of supervised learning. More specifically we experiment with the UCI dataset echocardiogram and Kaggle "Airline Passenger satisfaction" to test the accuracy of basic estimators such as GausianNB, Logistic Regression, SVM and MLP. The optimal goal is to find the best hyperparameters and create the best possible model to preprocess the data and then predict correctly the labels of the test data.

File echocardiogram.data contains the raw data of UCI project and you can also find datasets description in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/echocardiogram which is really important for the preprocessing part.

File train.csv and test.csv contains the raw data of Kaggle project which you can also find in the link: https://www.kaggle.com/kyriakospanagiotidis/mlp-and-svm-in-airline-passenger-satisfaction
