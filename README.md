# Supervised Learnig Project

In these projects we experiment with the basics classifiers of supervised learning. More specific we experiment in UCI dataset echocardiogram and Kaggle "Airline PAssanger sattisfaction" to test the accuracy of basic estimators such as GausianNB, Logistic Regrassion, SVM and MLP. The optimal goal is to find the best hyperparamerets and create the best possible model to predict corectly new upcoming values.

File echocardiogram.data contains the raw data of UCI project and you can also find datasets description in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/echocardiogram which is really important for the preprocesing part.

File train.csv and test.csv contains the raw data of Kaggle project whitch you can also find inthin link: https://www.kaggle.com/kyriakospanagiotidis/mlp-and-svm-in-airline-passenger-satisfaction
