# Neural-Networks

In this project is a an experiment with the basics classifiers of supervised learning. More specific we experiment in UCi dataset echocardiogram and we test the accuracy of basic estimators such as GausianNB and Logistic Regration. I try find the best hyperparamerets and create the best possible model to predict corectly if a ypothetic patient will survive after a heart attack besed on certain given features.
