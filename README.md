# Supervised Learnig Project

In this project we experiment with the basics classifiers of supervised learning. More specific we experiment in UCI dataset echocardiogram and we test the accuracy of basic estimators such as GausianNB and Logistic Regrassion. The optimal goal is to find the best hyperparamerets and create the best possible model to predict corectly new upcoming values.

File echocardiogram.data contains the raw data and you can also find datasets description in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/echocardiogram which is really important for the preprocesing part.
